# Growth Factor Analysis

This repository contains a Julia script designed for the precise calculation of growth factors in matrices, particularly those exhibiting significant growth under perturbation. The script employs rational numbers for all computations, ensuring exact arithmetic throughout the process. This approach aims to yield the exact growth that would be observed in the absence of perturbation.

## Usage

To run the script, simply execute it in a Julia environment:

```bash
julia growth.jl
```
